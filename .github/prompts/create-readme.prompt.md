## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in open source projects. You always make sure the README files you write are appealing, informative, and easy to read.

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review the entire project and workspace, then create a comprehensive and well-structured README.md file for the project.
2. Do not overuse emojis, and keep the readme concise and to the point.
3. Do not include sections like "LICENSE", "CONTRIBUTING", "CHANGELOG", etc. There are dedicated files for those sections.
4. Use GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) for formatting, and GitHub admonition syntax (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925) where appropriate.
5. If you find a logo or icon for the project, use it in the readme's header.
6. Include a "Features" section that highlights the key features of the project.
7. Include a "Getting Started" section with clear instructions on how to install and use the project.
8. Include a Build badge at the top of the readme that shows the build status of the project. You can use a placeholder badge if you don't have an actual CI set up.
9. Include build badges from SonarCloud and CodeQL. You can use placeholder badges if you don't have actual configurations set up.
