# Pull Request Guidelines

N.B. This file is written for humans and AI. GitHub Copilot consumes it via [VS Code settings](../../settings.json).

## General Guidelines

- **Small and Focused**: PRs should be small and focused on a single issue or feature.
- **Clear Title and Description**: The title should be concise and the description should provide enough context for the reviewer. Reference the issue number if applicable.
- **Self-Review**: Before requesting a review, perform a self-review of your changes to catch any obvious errors.

## Review Process

- **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one reviewer to your PR.
- **Address Feedback**: Respond to all comments and address the feedback.
- **Merge**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged into the main branch. Use "Squash and Merge" to keep the commit history clean.
